# wisp-crystal
tldr: A wisp-js port to crystal-lang

## Stability untested, only basic testing was done to see if it "works"
## No UDP support, some other things might be broken, not really sure.
  
  > `How to use?`

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Install crystal (https://crystal-lang.org/install/)

> Clone this repo and cd into it

> For testing run `crystal run demo.cr` if you make a program using it you can have a production compile with `crystal build demo.cr --release --no-debug --progress -o demo` (replace demo with your program)
