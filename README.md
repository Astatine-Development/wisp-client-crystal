# wisp-client-crystal
tldr: A janky wisp-client-js port to crystal-lang, expect bugs.

Stability untested, only basic testing was done to see if it "works"
No UDP support, some other things might be broken, not really sure.

client.cr is the actual client, demo.cr is a demo showcasing its usage.
  
> # `How to use?`

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Install crystal (https://crystal-lang.org/install/)

> Clone this repo and cd into it

> For testing run `crystal run demo.cr` if you make a program using it you can have a production compile with `crystal build demo.cr --release --no-debug --progress -o demo` (replace demo with your program)
